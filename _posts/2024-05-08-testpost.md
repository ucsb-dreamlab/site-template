This is an example 'post'. Posts are separate pages, with their own content and
URL. To make a post, create a file in the `_posts` folder; the file name should 
use the format `YY-MM-DD-title.md`. For example:

- `2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md`
- `2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md`

The markdown file for the post should include (at least) `layout: post` and 
a tile. For example:

```md
---
title: My new post
layout: post

This is an example 'post'. Posts are separate pages, with their own content and
URL...
